# ChatSwitch
 A mod that will allow you to switch between IC or OOC by pressing TAB. This mod was taken from older mod by some other developer but that has been depreciated and for old samp versions. So, I re-coded it

# Download and Installing Instruction:
  - On the right side you will see **Release** tab. Click on that. You will get download instructions. or [Click Here](https://github.com/Adib23704/LUA-ChatSwitch/releases)
  - Goto **moonloader** folder and Drag n Drop everything to your **GTA SA Game Folder** > **Moonloader** folder.
  - You'll get message on chat when game launches. If it doesn't work contact with me thru Discord: **Adib23704#8947**

# Important Notes:
- All you have to do is open chat box and if you press **TAB** then it will show you that its OOC or IC.
